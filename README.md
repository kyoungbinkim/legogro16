The arkworks ecosystem consist of Rust libraries for designing and working with __zero knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments (zkSNARKs)__. 
This repository contains an implementation of the LegoGroth16, the [LegoSNARK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142) variant of [Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260) zkSNARK proof system.  
This project started as fork of [this](https://github.com/kobigurk/legogro16) but is updated to 
- commit to a subset of the witnesses by specifying the count, say `n`, of the witnesses to commit during CRS generation. 
  By convention, it commits to the first `n` variables allocated for witnesses in the circuit and the proof contains that commitment
- either contain CP_link as well or omit it but only have the proof contain the commitment. The proof here contains 2 commitments (one is same as above)
  to the witness variables but with different commitment keys and randomness. 

The zkSNARK for Linear Subspaces from appendix D of LegoSNARK paper is [here](src/link/snark.rs).


This library is released under the MIT License and the Apache v2 License (see [License](#license)).

**WARNING:** This is an academic proof-of-concept prototype, and in particular has not received careful code review. This implementation is NOT ready for production use.

## Build guide

The library compiles on the `stable` toolchain of the Rust compiler. To install the latest version of Rust, first install `rustup` by following the instructions [here](https://rustup.rs/), or via your platform's package manager. Once `rustup` is installed, install the Rust toolchain by invoking:
```bash
rustup install stable
```

After that, use `cargo`, the standard Rust build tool, to build the library:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lovesh/legogroth16
cargo build --release
```

This library comes with unit tests for each of the provided crates. Run the tests with:
```bash
cargo test
```

To build without `std` but with Circom support and proof aggregation, run 
```
cargo build --no-default-features --features=circom,aggregation,wasmer-sys
```

To build for WASM with Circom support and proof aggregation, run
```
cargo build --no-default-features --features=circom,aggregation,wasmer-js --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

To run all tests without `std`, run
```
cargo test --no-default-features --features=std,circom,aggregation,wasmer-sys
```
